    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p1>I am originally from Houston, Texas. I am a junior at Texas A&M University, and I am currently pursuing a Computing major.
      My interest in computer science began in high school because of a wonderful teacher and her equally wonderful computer science classes.
    </p1>
    <h3>I am interested in accessibility because:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I previously had to create a website that met certain accessibility standards.</li>
        <li>It is a useful skill to learn for future career opportunities.</li>
        <li>I want to contribute to a more accessible future. It is not fair for those with disabilities to be left behind when technology is so advanced.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Some of my hobbies include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Doing people's nails.</li>
        <li>Playing FPS games.</li>
        <li>Covering songs with friends.</li>
    </ul>
